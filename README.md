 In this study, we compared two crowd counting methods: density-based using CSRNet, with VGG16 and VGG19 as backbones, and regression-based (InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2). ResNet50 demonstrated superior performance across models, achieving a MAE of 1.56 on the Mall dataset, while CSRNet with VGG-19 yielded a MAE of 1.57. These findings show ResNet50's effectiveness for regression-based crowd counting and CSRNet's potential for density-based crowd estimation.
